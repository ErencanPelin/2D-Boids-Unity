@author Erencan Pelin 2021


Complete 2D Boids project in Unity from the showcase on YouTube<br>

Feel free to use this project in any way you want or to adapt it in any way with the MIT license.<br>

<b>Info</b>
Boids is a simple AI flocking algorithm to simulate what is similar to a flock of birds. Each individual boid follows 3 laws: Avoidance, Seperation & Alignment.<br>
Each boid therefore acts on its own, yet they cooperate in a group. BEHOLD! true AI... kind of.. Enjoy the project! :D
